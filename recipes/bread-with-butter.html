    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>loaf of your favorite bread (such as a crusty baguette or a hearty whole wheat loaf)</li>
        <li>Butter, preferably at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        Slice the bread into desired thickness. You can go for thicker slices for a heartier bite or thinner slices for a lighter snack.
        Spread a generous amount of butter onto each slice of bread. If the butter is too cold to spread easily, you can let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes or gently microwave it for a few seconds until softened.
        Serve and enjoy! Optionally, you can toast the bread slices before spreading the butter for a warm and crispy treat.
    </ol>
