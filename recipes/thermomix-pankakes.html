    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into the mixing bowl of the Thermomix.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and mix the dry ingredients together for a few seconds on speed 3 until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, milk, and melted butter to the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and mix the batter on speed 4 for about 10-15 seconds, or until the batter is smooth and well combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed and mix again briefly.</li>
        <li>Let the batter rest for a few minutes while you preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the skillet is hot, lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the skillet for each pancake, spreading it slightly with the back of a spoon if necessary to form a round shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes on one side, or until bubbles start to form on the surface and the edges look set.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes using a spatula and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes made with the Thermomix!</li>
